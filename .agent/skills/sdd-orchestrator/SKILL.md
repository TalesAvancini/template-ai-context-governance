# SDD Orchestrator

This skill guides the Orchestrator (Hub) through the FULL Spec-Driven Development (SDD) lifecycle in the H.O.K Forge framework. As the Hub, your job is not only to start the process, but to define safety limits, fill the YAML frontmatter and scope allow list, run the vaccine injection, support the executor (`spec-driver`), promote recurring errors to the Ledger, and formalize final closure.

## Instructions

### Step 0: Pre-Flight Check (Git Cleanliness)

Before drafting any spec, you MUST ensure the workspace is clean to prevent SAM auditor errors ("Modificação Silenciosa" ou "Ghost Couplings") leaking into the new sprint.
1. Run `git status --short` or `git status --ignored`.
2. If there are uncommitted modifications (M, A, ??), you MUST explicitly commit them (e.g. `chore: setup ...`) and register them in the `JOURNAL.md` propagation matrix BEFORE starting the spec draft.
3. Only proceed to Step 1 if the Git tree is completely clean for the feature scope.

### Step 1: Blast Radius Calculation (Propagation Matrix)

Before writing any spec, you must understand the impact of the intended changes. Identify the core files that will be modified (Propagation Seed).

Execute the blast radius script:
```bash
python .context/_scripts/blast_radius.py --changed <PROPAGATION_SEED_FILES> --format text
```

Analyze the output buckets (`must_update`, `likely_update`, `declared_only`).

### Step 2: Draft the Spec (The Payload & Boundaries)

1. Read the `.agent/templates/spec_v3.md` template.
2. Draft the new specification document. You MUST meticulously fill the YAML frontmatter (`feature_id`, `type`, `contract_mode`, etc.).
3. **Scope Allow List**: You MUST explicitly populate the `scope_allow` array in the YAML with the global mandatory files PLUS all the specific feature files identified in the Blast Radius. This acts as the Physical Check (Scope Guard).
4. **Propagation & Limits**: Define a strict `max_impact_radius` (the maximum acceptable number of file changes) to act as a circuit breaker.
5. **Raw Payloads**: You OBRIGATORIAMENTE must inject the actual texts of relevant rules and constraints directly into the Spec's Section 5. 
6. Save the drafted spec in the `.specs/features/` directory.

### Step 3: Human Ratification, Vaccine & Delegation

1. **Ratification:** Show the drafted Spec to the user and ask for explicit approval. Do NOT proceed or delegate to the executor until the user ratifies the Spec.
2. Before delegating, you MUST run the MiMo injection to insert Scars into the Spec:
```bash
npm run context:inject
```
3. Verify that the `*.enriched.md` file was generated.
4. Hand off execution to the `spec-driver` subagent (e.g., via `/spec-driver [instrução]`), passing the path to the spec.
5. Once delegated, **do not close the task**. Wait for execution.

### Step 4: Handle Escalations & The Immune System

During Phase C, the `@spec-driver` might hit safety limits and issue a `[HANDOFF: ESCALATION]`.
- **If `[BLOCKED]`**: 
  1. Review the escalation request in the `INBOX` of `AGENT_SCRATCHPAD.md`.
  2. Write your clear solution or directive in the `DIRECTIVES` section of the Scratchpad.
  3. Reply with: `@spec-driver [RESUME] Diretiva injetada no Scratchpad. Leia a seção DIRECTIVES e retome a execução de onde parou no STATE.md.`
- **If `⚠️ SCOPE_BLOWOUT`**: You must abort the current spec, use the telemetria provided to re-fragment the feature into smaller, atomic specs, and restart the process.
- **The Immune System (Faxina Cognitiva)**: If the same error is escalated across multiple sprints, you MUST promote it permanently by adding it to `SSD_ERRORS_LEDGER.md` or updating the Spec restrictions.

### Step 5: Receive Signoff & Final Closure

In Phase D, the `spec-driver` will invoke the `@qa-validator` for the final audit.
Wait for the `@qa-validator` to return `qa_signoff: true` (or rejection).
- If **rejected**: Pass the feedback back to `@spec-driver` for correction.
- If **true**: The feature is technically complete.
- **Final Hub Duties**: As the Orchestrator, you must now validate the SAM (Sistema Anti-Migué), ensure that the `CLOSURE.md` synthesis file is generated (either by you or the executor), and perform the final commit and archival of the spec.

## Examples

### Example 1: Escalation Handling
User says: "[HANDOFF: ESCALATION] Error X happened."
Actions:
1. Hub reads `INBOX` in `AGENT_SCRATCHPAD.md`.
2. Hub writes solution in `DIRECTIVES` section of `AGENT_SCRATCHPAD.md`.
3. Hub tells SD: `@spec-driver [RESUME] Diretiva injetada no Scratchpad. Leia a seção DIRECTIVES e retome a execução de onde parou no STATE.md.`
